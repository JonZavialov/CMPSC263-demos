# CMPSC 263 - Blockchain and Modern Web Dev

## Demo 2- CSS

In this demo, we'll use our one-page HTML example from Demo 1 and add some styling to it. You can follow these steps to open the HTML document using Visual Studio Code's Live Server extension.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine. You can do this using the following command in your terminal:

   ```
      git clone https://github.com/JonZavialov/CMPSC263-demos
   ```

2. **Open the Project**: Open Visual Studio Code and click on "File" > "Open Folder" to open the `Demo 2- CSS` folder that you just cloned.

3. **Install Live Server (if not already installed)**:

   - If you don't have the Live Server extension installed, you can do so by going to the [Live Server Extension page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and clicking the "Install" button.

4. **Open the HTML File**: In the Visual Studio Code file explorer, navigate to the project folder and find the `index.html` file. Right-click on it and select "Open with Live Server."

5. **View the Demo**: Your default web browser will automatically open with the HTML demo. If not, you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:5500/index.html` in your web browser.

## Demo Contents

This demo uses the same HTML file as Demo 1, with the line below added, which links the CSS page. Explore some of the declarations in the CSS file to see how it effects the page.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css" />
```

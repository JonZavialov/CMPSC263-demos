# CMPSC 263 - Blockchain and Modern Web Dev

## Demo 1- HTML

In this demo, we'll start with a simple one-page HTML example to get you familiar with the basics. You can follow these steps to open the HTML document using Visual Studio Code's Live Server extension.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this GitHub repository to your local machine. You can do this using the following command in your terminal:

   ```
      git clone https://github.com/JonZavialov/CMPSC263-demos
   ```

2. **Open the Project**: Open Visual Studio Code and click on "File" > "Open Folder" to open the `Demo 1- HTML` folder that you just cloned.

3. **Install Live Server (if not already installed)**:

   - If you don't have the Live Server extension installed, you can do so by going to the [Live Server Extension page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and clicking the "Install" button.

4. **Open the HTML File**: In the Visual Studio Code file explorer, navigate to the project folder and find the `index.html` file. Right-click on it and select "Open with Live Server."

5. **View the Demo**: Your default web browser will automatically open with the HTML demo. If not, you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:5500/index.html` in your web browser.
